# Kneeboard
A collection of aircraft checklists, templates, and documents -- used before, during, and after flight.

## Cessna C172M Checklist
The Cessna 172M checklist is based on the 1976 Cessna 172M "Skyhawk" Pilot Operating Manual (POH), has been honed over many sorties, and enriched with elements of [AQP](https://flightchops.com/grassroots/).

## In-Flight Notes Template
I prefer pencil and paper over an EFB touchscreen. The kneeboard-sized, note-taking template is designed to help organize important information for all phases of flight, and to compliment the checklist and EFB as a reminder of what's expected next. It can be used for both VFR and IFR flights.

Example of use -- VFR cross-country from LAX to SAN:

## macOS Print Settings and Folding Instructions
The PDFs are designed to print on standard 8" x 11" paper. The following are the ideal macOS print settings (Window should have similar options):
* Two-Sided: checked
* Black & White: checked
* Scale: 100%
* Quality: Best
* Layout: Two-Sided, Short-Edge binding

And here's how you fold them:
